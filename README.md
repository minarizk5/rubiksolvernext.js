This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

### Handling ESLint Warnings

If you encounter ESLint errors during the build process, you can use one of these approaches:

1. Fix all ESLint errors in the code (recommended)
2. Run the build with ESLint disabled:

```bash
npm run build:no-lint
# or
NEXT_DISABLE_ESLINT=1 npm run build
```

3. Update the `.eslintrc.json` file to downgrade specific rules from errors to warnings

### Important Deployment Notes

- Do not upload the `.next` directory to version control
- Ensure you're using Node.js 18.17 or later for compatibility with Next.js 15.3.0
